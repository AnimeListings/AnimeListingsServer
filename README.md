This is a personal project for listing animes/tv_series. It orginally started as an MVC project, so it still has some views from the MVC portion; but I have been working on coverting this project to API for angular

The project itself uses serval features such as:
-JWT(json web token)
-Google authentication
-Standalone authentication
-API Requests for the angular framework
-Connecting to remote MYSQL database
-Custom Action Filters

Still Finishing:
-Removing all views
-Converting entire project to API
